            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p>
                Ada Lovelace was one of the first women to become involved in the technology of computers. Born Augusta Ada Byron on 10 December 1815 in London, Ada was the daughter of Lord Byron, the famous poet. The tempestuous Lord Byron married Annabella Millbanke in 1815, but their marriage was very unhappy, and the two separated just one month after their child, Augusta Ada, was born.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her mother, fearful that young Ada had inherited her father’s tempestuous character, had her tutored in mathematics and music in an attempt to counter any tendencies toward becoming a poet. In fact, Ada inherited both her father’s intelligence and his psychological imbalance. Ada excelled in mathematics, but her education was sometimes interrupted by a mysterious chronic illness, which may have been psychosomatic. For instance, a severe “attack” at age 14 left her unable to walk for almost three years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Things changed for Ada when, at age 18, she heard a lecture by Charles Babbage, an English mathematician who had recently developed the idea for a mechanical calculator that he called the Difference Engine. The next year, she was married to William King, the future Lord Lovelace. Two years later, now using her husband’s new title, she began to correspond with Babbage as Countess Ada Lovelace. Then in 1844, she volunteered to translate for Babbage an article written in Italian about the Difference Engine. Babbage, impressed with her work, encouraged her to append her own comments to the translation, which she did. In this way, Lovelace publicly contributed to the ongoing development of computing technology. Her notes included instructions for using the Difference Engine to calculate so-called Bernoulli numbers, a feat that has earned her the title of the first computer programmer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Ada’s life was not always happy. As her mother feared, Ada was afflicted by the same psychological problems that had made her father so difficult. She suffered a mental breakdown followed by chronic problems with breathing and eating. She saw a doctor about these problems, but his regimen of medicines, which included addictive drugs such as heroin and morphine, caused her to suffer delusions. She beat these addictions, and the delusions ended, but she then became obsessed with betting on horse races, and in the 1840s accumulated a considerable gambling debt. At the height of all this, she was struck by cancer and died at the early age of 36 on 27 November 1852.

            <p>
                Computers and electronics play an enormous role in today's society, impacting everything from communication and medicine to science.
            </p>

            <p>
                Although computers are typically viewed as a modern invention involving electronics, computing predates the use of electrical devices. The ancient abacus was perhaps the first digital computing device. Analog computing dates back several millennia as primitive computing devices were used as early as the ancient Greeks and Romans, the most known complex of which being the Antikythera mechanism. Later devices such as the castle clock (1206), slide rule (c. 1624) and Babbage's Difference Engine (1822) are other examples of early mechanical analog computers.
            </p>

            <p>
                The introduction of electric power in the 19th century led to the rise of electrical and hybrid electro-mechanical devices to carry out both digital (Hollerith punch-card machine) and analog (Bush’s differential analyzer) calculation. Telephone switching came to be based on this technology, which led to the development of machines that we would recognize as early computers.
            </p>

            <p>
                The presentation of the Edison Effect in 1885 provided the theoretical background for electronic devices. Originally in the form of vacuum tubes, electronic components were rapidly integrated into electric devices, revolutionizing radio and later television. It was in computers however, where the full impact of electronics was felt. Analog computers used to calculate ballistics were crucial to the outcome of World War II, and the Colossus and the ENIAC, the two earliest electronic digital computers, were developed during the war.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the invention of solid-state electronics, the transistor and ultimately the integrated circuit, computers would become much smaller and eventually affordable for the average consumer. Today “computers” are present in nearly every aspect of everyday life, from watches to automobiles.

            <h3>Category: Energy</h3>
            <p>
                Energy and powered devices are an integral part of society. Humanity's earliest days saw the discovery of fire through wood combustion, and the use of charcoal for smelting metals dates back as early as 5000 BC. Powered devices using natural energy sources such as water and wind were introduced by the Ancient Greeks and were commonly used until the 18th century steam engine revolutionized the way devices could be powered. Various natural oils were used for a range of purposes, such as whale oil for lamps. The Industrial Revolution led to the massive use of coal as fuel, and the extraction of petroleum and various other oils became extremely important with the advent of internal combustion engines. Electrical power, also based on fossil fuels, became widespread at the end of the 19th century and the production of cleaner electrical energy through nuclear, hydropower, geothermal, and solar means is a topic even more relevant to today's world.

            <p>
                Engineering and technological advancements are usually not born from a vacuum, but instead originate from a specific need in society. These needs can be quite broad in scope and can range from military applications to leisure. The mass distribution of electric power, the introduction of computing, transportation infrastructure, mineral extraction and the synthesis of various chemicals and materials have all had profound effects on our day to day lives.

        <h3>Category: Communications</h3>
            <p>
                Communications refers to the use of signals to transfer voice, data, image, and/or video information between locations, the main applications of which are in communications science, engineering, and technology. From the bonfires and smoke signals to early modern optical telegraphs, humankind has attempted to move communication beyond the realm of earshot. Among the first practical uses of electrical engineering, early communication devices included the telegraph, first conceived in the 1700s and realized in 1837 by Charles Wheatstone and William Cooke and by Samuel Morse. Through the next century, advancements in the telephone, radio, television and today's Internet, completely changed the way people communicate and interact with one another.
